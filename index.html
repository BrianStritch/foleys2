                Our beef is renowned for its quality and delicious flavor. The way we guarantee the highest quality in beef in
                 both texture and flavor is by choosing Irish beef and the highest grade of traditional breeds of cattle. 
                 Our cattle are chosen on the basis of fat content, marbling and quality to ensure a consistency of flavour. 
                 All the beef from our butchers is completely grass fed and is matured for a minimum of 28 days to intensify 
                 beef flavour and tenderness.
